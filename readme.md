## crystalhand updates:
<ul>
  <li>Added a break out section for the pinkie/outside 2 columns so that they could be split from the main section. Allows for same PCB to be used with Dactyl and Manuform</li>
<li>I added some extra through hole locations to access the columns and rows.  </li>
<li>I redid the silk screen column and rows to make them accurate for left and right hand</li>
<li>Some trimming of edges of PCB to make it fit better on my case</li>
<li>Added additional easy break tabs for smaller versions of Manuform</li>
</ul>

Flexible PCB made for the Dactyl Manuform Mini - up to 6x6 and breakable down to 5x3.
